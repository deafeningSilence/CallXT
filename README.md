# CallXT

CallXT is an Android app that sends the *subject of the call* along with the call and is received at the receiver end as a pop-up. It integrates the calling and texting features into one activity. This comes in very handy when the other person has to know the subject of the call and also during an emergency. It changes the pop-up according to the type of the text message sent. CallXT has a low level text analysis system to find the context of the call and display the pop-up accordingly.

This hack won the Runner-up at the [Ingenius2016](https://ingenius2016.hackerearth.com/), held at PESIT-BSC.

# Using the application

</p>

The application works similar to the phone's dialer application. On opening the application, you will land on a dialer which acts as a normal dialer where you can enter a phone number and place a call by pressing the call button. 

## Message box

</p>

By long pressing the call button, a pop-up will appear with an empty text box. This text box is used to enter messages that are to be sent to the reciever along with the call. The message is sent as an SMS and is tagged with details to identify the call it is related to on the receiver's mobile, once the call has been placed.

## On the receiving end

The message sent along with the call from the sender is viewed as a pop-up on the reciving end. This message can also be viewed later on by the reciever from his SMS inbox.

callXT also has a text analysis feature that gives it the ability to understand and classify the messages being sent, and will display the pop-up accordingly. These pop-ups have different styles that correspond to the type of message being sent.
